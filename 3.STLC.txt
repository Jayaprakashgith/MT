STLC:
-----
--> Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is defined as a sequence of activities conducted to perform Software Testing.

Phases of STLC:
---------------

1.Requirement Analysis
2.Test Planning
3.Test Design

4.Test execution
5.Sign Off

--> Each of these phases have a definite Entry and Exit criteria.

 Entry Criteria(Input):
 ----------------------
Entry Criteria gives the prerequisite items need to start a phase.

 Exit Criteria(Output): 
 ----------------------
Exit Criteria defines the items that must be concluded when a phase is completed.


1.Requirement Analysis:
 -----------------------
Entry Criteria: BR Document and Design Specification Document

--> We need to Understand the requirements
--> If we have any doubts means mark it in query logs
--> Clarification of doubts will be done in walkthrough session by BA
--> Identify types of tests to be performed
--> Get application access

Exit Criteria: Finalized scope.

 2.Test Planning: 
  ----------------
Entry Criteria: Finalized scope

--> Done by testing team lead
--> Preparation of test plan document which includes
--> Inscope and Outscope
--> Types of Testing and its uses
--> Test tool selection 
--> Date Calculation
--> Resource planning

Exit Criteria: Test Plan Document.

3.Test Design:
--------------
Entry Criteria: Test Plan Document

--> Create test case document with test scenario, test case and test data
--> Review test cases with peer or lead
--> RTM(Requiremnet Tracability Matrix) will be done by Testing Team Lead
--> Get Approval from BA
--> Automation testers will do skeleton script

Exit Criteria: Test Case Document.

4.Test Execution:
-----------------
Entry Criteria: Test Case Document

--> Execute tests as per plan
--> Raise defects and Track the defects to closure
--> Document test results

Exit Criteria: Execution  Result.

5.Sign Off:
-----------
Entry Criteria: Execution  Result

--> Will be done by Testing Team Manager
--> Test result analysis
--> Evaluate cycle completion
--> Prepare Test closure report.

Exit Criteria: Closure Document.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Scenario:
--------------
It is an idea of what we are going to test.

Test Case:
----------
It is an idea of how we are going to test.

Test Data:
----------
The actual input which we are going to use in the application for testing.

Defect:
---------
When the expected and actual is not matching, then it is a defect.

Bug:
------
When the tester raise a defect to developer then it is called as bug.
