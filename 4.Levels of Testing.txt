Levels of Testing:
------------------
--> The testing done at various levels and by whom it is done is called Levels of Testing.
--> There are 4 levels of testing. If theses 4 levels of testing is completed only, we can say the application is ready for release.

1.Unit Testing - Developers
2.Integration Testing - Testers with help of developers
3.System Testing - Testers
4.Acceptance Testing - Client

White Box Testing Technique:
----------------------------
Testing done based on applications internal coding knowledge. It is done by developers. 
White Box Testing is also called as Glass Box, Clear Box, and Structural Testing. 

Black Box Testing Technique:
----------------------------
Testing done without looking at the internal coding knowledge. It is done by testers.

1.Unit Testing:
---------------
--> Testing an individual module in an application
--> Done by Developers 
--> Test based on White Box Testing Technique.

2.Integration Testing:
----------------------
--> Combining or merging two modules
--> Done by Testers with the help of developers
--> Test based on Black Box Testing Techniques
--> Top-down Approach - Higher level combinations of units
--> Bottom-up Approach - Lower level combinations of units
--> Big Bang Approach - Combining all combination of units.

3.System Testing:
-----------------
--> Complete Application Testing
--> Done by Testers
--> Test based on Black Box Testing Technique
--> Types of System Testing: Functional Testing and Non Functional Testing
--> If theses 2 types of testing is completed only, we can say system testing is completed.

4.Acceptance Testing:
---------------------
--> Satisfying client requirement
--> Done by client side
--> To get approval from client.
