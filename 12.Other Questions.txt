Other Important Questions:
--------------------------

1.Outsprint or n-1 Sprint:
--------------------------
-->To automate user stories for the previous sprint, is called out-sprint automation.
-->Consider there were few User stories from previous Sprint which could be automated. 
-->We will automate it in current sprint, which is called as n-1 or outsprint automation.

2.Insprint in Agile:
--------------------
-->To develop and automate user stories in the same sprint, is called in-sprint automation.
-->Consider there were few user stories in a sprint which could be automated then, we will be writing skeleton scripts untill the developer develop the application. 
-->Once the build is delivered to testing team, after that we will execute the scripts.

3.Velocity:
-------------
-->Total Number of user story points consider in a particular sprint (We can say 40 Points)

4.Risk Based Testing:
---------------------
-->Identifying the functionalities which seems to cause failures to the application and then testing those functionalities.

5.Bug Leakage:
---------------
-->Bug which is missed by the testing team while testing and if it is found by the end user or customer in Live Environment.

6.Bug Release:
--------------
-->Releasing the application to the Live Environment with the known bugs then we call it as Bug Release. 

7.Defect Age:
-------------
-->It is the time interval between date of defect detection and date of defect closure. 
-->Defect Age = Date of defect closure   Date of defect detection.

8.HotFix:
---------
-->A bug which needs to handle as more than high priority bug and needs to be fix it immediately.

9.RTM:
------
-->Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is used to trace the requirements are done by the testing side by matching the requirement with test cases.

10.Test Strategy:
------------------
-->Documents like Test Plan are prepared by keeping this document as a base.
-->It is done by project manager.
-->It is a high-level document which captures the approach on how we go about testing the product and achieve the goals.

11.Exploratory Testing:
------------------------
-->Usually, this process will be carried out by domain experts. 
-->They perform testing just by exploring the functionalities of the application without having the knowledge of the requirements.
