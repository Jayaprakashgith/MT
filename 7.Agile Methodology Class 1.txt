SDLC Methodologies:
--------------------
1.WaterFall Model
2.V-Model Of Testing
3.Iterative Model
4.Agile Model

1.Waterfall Model:
------------------
-->Simple and easy to understand and use.
-->Each phase has specific deliverables and review processes.
-->Not suitable for projects where requirements are at a risk of changing.
-->Not a good model for complex and long projects.
-->Mostly Developers and testers will not have direct contact.

2.V-Model:
----------
The V-model is an SDLC model where execution of processes happens in a sequential manner in a V-shape. It is also known as Verification and Validation model.

3.Iterative Model:
------------------
We are going to iterate each functionality in to each part and design,develop and test and deploy.

4.Agile Model:
--------------
-->Agile methodology is a practice that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing. Here both development and testing activities are concurrent unlike the Waterfall model.

[Note: Framework - Scrum and Kanban] 

Scrum:
------
-->Roles
-->Artifacts
-->Cermonies

Roles:
------
Product Owner --> Product Owner defines requirements of the product, prioritize according to the market value & profitability and decides release date.
Scrum Master --> Scrum Master manages the team, responsible for setting up the team, scrum meeting invite.
Scrum Team --> Developers and Testers.

Artifacts:
---------- 
Userstory --> Short explanation of requirements.

Acceptance Criteria --> Detailed explanation of requirements. Each userstory have an acceptance criteria

Product Backlog	--> Collection of Userstories captured for a scrum project managed by Product Owner.

Sprint Backlog	--> No of userstories taken for a patricular sprint.

Sprint	--> Set period of time to complete the user stories usually 2 to 3 weeks of time.	

BurnUp and Burndown Chart --> Burn-up chart illustrates the amount of completed work in a project and the burn-down chart illustrates the amount of work remained to complete a project.
